# Theme

A slightly updated version of <https://github.com/itotm/plymouth-themes>.

Changes:

- Updated mode texts (reboot, update, etc)
- Less visual clutter (removed unnecessary keyboard indicators)
- Updated prompt position

Todo (probably would have to use `script`):
- Don't hide logo during password prompt
- Use CSS-Grid-like spacing for text
- Display a different message when resuming from hinbernation
