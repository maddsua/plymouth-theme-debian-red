# Theme

A slightly updated version of <https://github.com/itotm/plymouth-themes>.

Changes:

- Updated mode texts (reboot, update, etc)
- Less visual clutter (removed unnecessary keyboard indicators)
- Updated prompt position

Todo (probably would have to use `script`):
- Don't hide logo during password prompt
- Use CSS-Grid-like spacing for text
- Make sure tha the hibernation message is always displayed, regardless of how long it takes the system to resume

## Installing

Kinda the whole point of this repo is to have a single .deb package that you could just install. 

Head to <https://github.com/maddsua/plymouth-theme-debian-red/releases/latest> and grab the package file there. You know what to do next.
